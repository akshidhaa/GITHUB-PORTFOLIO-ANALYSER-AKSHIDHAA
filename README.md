This project is a GitHub Portfolio Analyzer that assists students in understanding how recruiters assess their profiles. It takes a GitHub profile URL and analyzes public repositories to determine the quality of the portfolio and its readiness. The system produces a formatted GitHub Portfolio Score using documentation, repository structure, commit regularity, and overall project completeness. It identifies strengths and areas that could be considered red flags from a recruiter’s point of view. The system also assesses the ability of projects to convey real-world impact and problem-solving skills. Based on the analysis, it provides straightforward and actionable advice on how to improve presentation, organization, and credibility. The system displays the results in a simple, graphical, and easy-to-understand format. In general, the project fills the gap between technical skills and professional presence, assisting students in converting their GitHub profiles into excellent, recruiter-ready portfolios.
